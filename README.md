# Naive-Bayes
Implementation of Naive Bayes from scratch using Python.

* This is a python implementation of Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm (m-estimate version) for a binary classification problem from scratch. 
* The program will take two inputs: a training dataset and a test dataset. 
* The value of m will be the number of possible values of a feature. 
* All features will be categorical in the dataset. 
* The last column of the datasets will be the class variable. 
* The two-class values as positive and negative.
* The program will first load the training dataset, calculate all required probabilities, and then predict the class of each instance in the test set. 
* The program will add a new column containing predicted classes to the test dataset and save it as predictions.csv.
* The program will also show the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on the console
